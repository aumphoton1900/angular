The provided code snippet <form [formGroup]="Form" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()"> is a common structure used in Angular applications for creating reactive forms.
Here's a breakdown of what each part signifies:
<form>: This is the standard HTML form element.
[formGroup]="Form": This is an Angular property binding.
[formGroup] is a directive from Angular's Reactive Forms module. It binds the HTML form to a FormGroup instance defined in your component's TypeScript file.
"Form" refers to the name of the FormGroup instance you have created in your component's class. For example, in your component's .ts file, 
you might have public Form: FormGroup; and then initialize it in the constructor or ngOnInit with this.Form = new FormGroup(...).

(ngSubmit)="onSubmit()": This is an Angular event binding.
(ngSubmit) is an Angular event that triggers when the form is submitted. This event is typically fired when a user clicks a submit button 
within the form or presses the Enter key while focused on a form field. 
"onSubmit()" refers to a method defined in your component's TypeScript file. This method will be executed when the ngSubmit event occurs. 
Inside this onSubmit() method, you would typically handle the form data, perform validation, or send the data to a backend service.
