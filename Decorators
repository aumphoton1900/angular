1.  @Output decorator
 
The @Output decorator in Angular is used to create custom events that allow a child component 
to send data to its parent component. 
It works with EventEmitter to emit events that the parent can listen to.

1. @Output decorator

A property in a Component that emits a custom event is decorated with @Output decorator. For example in the statement
@Output() messageEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();

messageEvent property is decorated with @Output() which means this property is going to emit a custom event. That is why this property is of type EventEmitter.
